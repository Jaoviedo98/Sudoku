        <h2>Connect4</h2>
        <p>Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc
            from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest 
            available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line 
            of four of one's own discs</p>

        <h2>MineSweeper</h2>
        <p>The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them,
            with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 
            The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for many computing platforms in use today. </p>
